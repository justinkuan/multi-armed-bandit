# Multi-Armed Bandit Problem

The multi-armed bandit problem ["is a classic reinforcement learning problem that exemplifies the exploration-exploitation tradeoff dilemma."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit)

An intuitive version of this is to think about eating at your favorite restaurant vs. exploring new restaurants.  Do you go to your favorite restaurant all the time and  have a high confidence of the experience you will get?  Or do you explore new restaurants and potentially discover an even more amazing place?  Obviously, neither extreme is desirable, as in the first case, you'll never know if there is anything better, and in the second, you'll never revisit your favorite places.  But can we figure out where to draw that line?

Before you go off thinking this is simply another theoretical question mathy people like to answer, I will just say that this problem is one of the most common I've seen in industry, where companies must decide which ad to air.  Do they play their best ads or  try out new ads that might be even better?
